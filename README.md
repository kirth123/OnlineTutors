# OnlineTutors
I created a webapp that lets tutors and students talk to each other over video chat and collaborate using an interactive whiteboard. A user can draw on the whiteboard and the other user will be able to see the changes rendered on their side. Users can schedule appointments at a certain time and for a specific duration for when they want to set up their tutoring appointment. They can look for tutors that fit their needs with a customized search feature and find the tutor that will work best for them. This app was created using the MERN stack and can be accessed at https://onlinetutorstoday.net.
