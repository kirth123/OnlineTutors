I created a webapp that lets tutors and students talk to each other over video chat and collaborate using an interactive whiteboard. A user can draw on the whiteboard and the other user will be able to see the changes rendered on their side. Users can schedule appointments at a certain time and for a specific duration for when they want to set up their tutoring appointment. They can look for tutors that fit their needs with a customized search feature and find the tutor that will work best for them. This app was created using the MERN stack and uses WebRTC and WebSockets for the video chat and collaborative whiteboard features.
