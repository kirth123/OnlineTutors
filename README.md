# OnlineTutors
I created a videochat app to connect tutors and students and allow them to learn over long distances. The app was created using the MERN stack and can be accessed at https://onlinetutorstoday.net.  You can schedule appointments at a certain time and specific duration. The app is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance.
