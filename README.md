# OnlineTutors
I created a videochat app to connect tutors and students and allow them to learn over long distances. The app was created using the MERN stack and can be accessed at https://onlinetutorstoday.net.  You can schedule appointments at a certain time and specific duration. The app is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance.

I added a search feature so that you can find the best tutor or student for you.

You can update your profile with keywords so other tutors/students can find you.

Once you find someone you like, you can send them a message through the private messaging feature.

You can also see who has requested to talk to you.

You can set up appointments with your tutors with the schedule appointment feature.

The videochat feature was made possible by the WebRTC protocol. I created a signaling channel between the remote peers using WebSockets and established a data channel using SimplePeer. In addition, I made a collaborative whiteboard (using Websocket rooms) which both users can draw on.
